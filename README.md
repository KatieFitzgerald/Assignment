# Assignment 1
Repo for OOP Assignment

The theme of my project is tea!

My idea for this assignment:

- Find the top 10 countries that drink the most tea.
- Display their consumption in a bar chart.

- Find data on the most popular flavours on tea in the world.
- Display the flavours in a colourful word cloud (hopefully in the shape of a tea cup), with the size of each word depending on it's popularity.


# Final Submission:

- Bar Chart with the top 10 tea consumption countries per capita (actual accurate data).
- WordCloud with approx. 20 popular flavours of tea.
- WordCloud includes four animmated images of a cloud, that slide along the screen.
- The graphs can be switched between using two displayed buttons.
- The graphs also have a common colour spectrum of green and blue.
