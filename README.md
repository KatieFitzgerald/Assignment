# Assignment 1
Repo for OOP Assignment

The theme of my project is tea!

My idea for this assignment:

- Find the top 10 countries that drink the most tea.
- Display their consumption in a bar chart.
- Display their coffee consumption in a bar chart (on the same diagram).

- Find data on the most popular flavours on tea in the world.
- Display the flavours in a colourful word cloud (hopefully in the shape of a tea cup), with the size of each word depending on it's popularity.
